## FractiSI Multi-Agent platform

As of Workstation **0.2**, Tiny Footprint Multi-Agent is the **core execution technology** inside the unified **FractiSI Multi-Agent** product (coordination, composition, Git awareness, deploy approvals). Commercial tiers (Core / Professional / Enterprise) package capabilities — they are not separate products.

See [architecture assessment](../architecture/FRACTISI_MULTI_AGENT_PLATFORM_ASSESSMENT_2026-11.md).

**One shared world. Many agents.**

## What it is

**FractiSI Multi-Agent** is the flagship product: software installed **alongside** the agent runtime or serving stack you already run—not a new computer, not a stack replacement. One shared world (or shared organizational context) for many agents; per-agent deltas; selective reconstruct. **DRAM concurrency** is the engine inside.

## One engine · three editions

| Edition | Customer | Installed on | Pricing |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Local · Workstation Kit** | Developers / researchers | Personal computer | Free / Pro subscription |
| **Server** | Enterprises | Company GPU / agent hosts | Annual license |
| **Cloud · Platform** | Cloud / GPU operators | Provider infrastructure | Negotiated |

## Central idea

Without Tiny Footprint, each agent often retains a full copy of the shared world.  
With Tiny Footprint Multi-Agent, the world is registered once; each agent keeps compact differences; selective reconstruction builds the working set.
